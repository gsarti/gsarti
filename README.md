I am a PhD student at the University of Groningen [GroNLP Lab](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) and part of the project [InDeep: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Text and Sound](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/), working mainly on interpretability for neural machine translation. Previously, I was a research intern at [AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) NYC, a research scientist at [Aindo](https://www.aindo.com), a student in the [Data Science MSc](https://dsai.units.it/) at University of Trieste & SISSA and a founding member of the [AI Student Society](https://www.ai2s.it).

My research focuses on interpretability for NLP models, particularly to the benefit of end-users and by leveraging human behavioral signals. I am also very passionate about open-source collaboration :octocat: and I currently lead the development of the [Inseq toolkit](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq) for interpreting generative language models.
